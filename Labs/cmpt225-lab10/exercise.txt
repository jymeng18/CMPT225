YOUR TASKS FOR TODAY
*********************

1) implement the O(n) time selection algorithm we saw in class.
You may use the provided code as a starting point

2) In FindSmallHash.java write a function that gets a String prefix,
and returns a string that starts with prefix such that 
the returned string has hashCode() < 1000

3) In InverseHashString.java write a function that gets a number,
and returns a string whose hashCode() is that number.
