Extend the implementation of BSTs to support the following operations:
1) For each node store in the node the size of the subtree rooted at this node
2) For each node store in the node the height of the subtree rooted at this node

Write a method of the class BinarySearchTree that returns a sorted ArrayList with all elements of the tree.
